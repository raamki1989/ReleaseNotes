# Known issues

| Issue number | Overview of the issue |  Suggested workaround |
| ------------ | ------------------- | --------- |
|1| When more than 12 patches are added to the final report for a cell type, the system does not provide a visual indication that the maximum limit of 12 patches has been reached.Users may attempt to add additional patches without receiving feedback on the limitation. |Since the application limits the addition to a maximum of 12 patches, users should be aware that only up to 12 patches can be added for a cell image. Please ensure that the required patches are selected accordingly.|
|2|When the user clicks the home button in the microscopic view, the image does not zoom out to the default home position.|Users can manually use the zoom-out functionality to return the image to the default home position.|
|3|When the list of reports is filtered using bookmark comments, applying an additional filter does not automatically clear the existing bookmark filter.| Users can manually clear the filter for bookmarked comments to display all reports matching the applied additional filter.|
|4|In reports where the multiplication factor for the Platelet estimate has been modified, the updated multiplication factor is incorrectly displayed in the Original version of the report instead of the initial multiplication factor.|No corrective action is required, as the original report is intended for internal use only and is not shared with the patient.|
|5|When using the circle or line tool, if a user enters a value below 5 µm (lower limit) or above 20 µm (upper limit), no error message is displayed to the user.|If the data entry box is highlighted in red, it indicates an issue with the entered values. Refer to the user manual for the acceptable value range and adjust the input accordingly.|
